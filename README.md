# Tuido
Simple terminal to-do app built with Ratatui. Organize tasks into lists with custom columns, sort them by card properties, save locally as JSON and synchronize with git using commands.

## Project Status
Project is under development. Old repository was lost, rebuilding `core/` with old code.

## Features
### Minimal Viable Product:
- [x] Creating, deleting, and renaming lists
- [x] Creating, removing, and renaming columns (e.g. backlog, in progress, etc.)
- [x] Creating, deleting, and renaming cards in lists
- [x] Moving cards between columns
- [ ] Saving lists in separate JSON files after every change
- [ ] TUI using Ratatui
### Full Release:
- [ ] Importing and exporting lists to and from the user's desktop
- [ ] Adding, deleting, and renaming card properties (e.g. deadline date, priority, etc.)
- [ ] Sorting cards by their properties
- [ ] Manual Git synchronization (commit, push, and pull)
